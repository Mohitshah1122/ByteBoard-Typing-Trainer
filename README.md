The `sentences.txt` file acts as the core content provider for ByteBoard. It contains a list of pre-defined sentences which are:

- Short and varied to simulate realistic typing scenarios.
- Randomly selected to ensure each session is unique.
- Essential for performance evaluation and learning improvement.

Make sure this file exists and includes a good mix of sentences to maximize the benefits of the typing test.
